# practiceWebsite
<p>The basic purpose of the website is to practice JavaScript and practice communications between an android phone and website. For now, the website allows the user to
simply move an image around with the arrow keys and change the color of the background. The "myApp" project on this same GitHub account is expected to connect to this
website</p>
